# 2018-UMaryland-iGEM-PETase
This was the result of the 2018 UMaryland iGEM team's research efforts into PET plastic degradation by PETase production from E. coli and the creation of a protocatechuate (PCA) and terephthalate (TPA) detector. The model runs in MATLAB on SimBiology. Full description on our team's Wiki: http://2018.igem.org/Team:UMaryland/TPAvPCA
